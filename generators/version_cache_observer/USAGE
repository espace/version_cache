Description:
    The version_cache_observer generator creates an observer for use with the version_cache plugin.
    It maintains models versions in cache.

    The first argument is interpreted as the observer's name.
    The following arguments are taken to be the models which the observer will observe.

    The generator creates the observer class in app/models

Example:
    ./script/generate version_cache_observer Cache Topic Post

    This will create:
        Observer:      app/models/cache_observer.rb
        The cache_observer will observe Topic and Post models
        

    You should then run 'rake db:migrate'.
